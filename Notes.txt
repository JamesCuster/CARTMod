CARTMod Notes

Where I last left off

I just added the additionalInputs parameter to the addModule function. This was done so that the user could provide additoinal UI components to the
input modal that do not live in the inputData data.frame. This was add specifically to handle the fiscal year 19/20 distinction that is implmented in
CART in order to manipulate how the database assigns project IDs to projects that were initiated in the FY19.

Next steps would be...
To add the addModule to the projects and time functionality of CART.

These steps have not been taken yet because additional work needs to be done first

NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HANDLE STATIC CHOICES.
